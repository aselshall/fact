"9) AI Coding Assistance:  
How has the integration of AI coding assistance, such as Jupyter AI or ChatGPt, impacted your learning experience in the course, both positively and negatively?"
It was good to me! I like having a back up help when I can not resolver problems. 
I believe it helps me solve problems and makes the class seem more helpful, instead of learning to past a test we are actually learning to solve problems.
I used ChatGPT a lot in this course. I am disappointed that Jupyter AI did not work as well for me. I feel like while I am using ChatGPT I am not learning as much as I could, so I wish I had a stronger foundation without it instead of heavily relying on it. 
The use of LLM has been helpful but also lackluster as sometimes the LLM model is not structured to assist with certain things that I would need to be fixed.
It has helped a lot, I actually think more time allotted to AI coding assistance would have been an efficient use of time and would allow for less time to be focused on Pandas/NumPy/Xarray
AI coding assistance has helped me build the skeleton of my project and assisted me during homework problems.
It has allowed me to understand topics without seeking assistance first.
Negatively, it does not really help me much when I am learning extremely hard codes, and the AI give me complicated results, but the rest is positive for basic simple code. 
It has positively impacted learning by helping me diagnose errors when other resources, such as stack exchange and github forums, are unclear. 
Helped.
It helped me dive into the errors and understand why I was getting them and how to fix them.
Jupiter AI was unhelpful because it did not work. chatgpt was slightly helpful but it would be bad if i became too reliant on it 


#### **Positive Themes**
1. **Support in Problem Solving**: 
   - Students frequently mentioned that AI coding assistance, such as ChatGPT, provided valuable help when they encountered challenges in solving problems. Phrases like "I like having a back-up help" and "it helps me solve problems" indicate a sense of reliability in AI tools as a learning aid.
   - Several responses also emphasized that AI made the course feel more practical and focused on problem-solving rather than rote learning for exams.

2. **Error Diagnosis and Debugging**:
   - AI tools were praised for their ability to diagnose and explain errors. Students highlighted that AI assistance allowed them to "dive into the errors" and better understand why certain issues occurred, fostering a learning-by-fixing approach.

3. **Efficiency and Time Management**:
   - Some students noted that AI coding assistance allowed them to work more efficiently by reducing the time spent on foundational tasks like mastering Pandas, NumPy, and Xarray. This freed them to focus on more advanced and conceptual aspects of the course.

4. **Building Project Structures**:
   - AI tools helped students lay the groundwork for projects. One student explicitly mentioned that AI "helped build the skeleton of my project," showcasing its value in scaffolding complex tasks.

5. **Independence in Learning**:
   - One student pointed out that AI tools allowed them to understand topics without seeking external assistance, suggesting that AI can promote self-directed learning.

#### **Negative Themes**
1. **Over-Reliance and Lack of Foundation**:
   - A recurring concern was that reliance on AI could hinder the development of a strong foundational understanding. One student stated, "I feel like while I am using ChatGPT I am not learning as much as I could," while another expressed concern about becoming "too reliant on it."

2. **Inconsistency in Performance**:
   - Some students found the assistance from AI tools inconsistent. For example, Jupyter AI was reported as "unhelpful because it did not work," while ChatGPT was described as only "slightly helpful." This suggests variability in tool performance and reliability.

3. **Complexity of AI Responses**:
   - Students mentioned that AI tools sometimes provided overly complex or irrelevant answers, particularly when dealing with "extremely hard codes." This highlights a limitation in AIâ€™s ability to adapt to the specific needs of students.

4. **Gap in Addressing Learning Needs**:
   - While AI tools were beneficial for basic and straightforward coding tasks, students felt they lacked effectiveness for advanced or nuanced problems. One student mentioned, "the LLM model is not structured to assist with certain things that I would need to be fixed."

#### **Mixed Feelings**
1. **Missed Potential of Tools**:
   - While ChatGPT was seen as helpful, Jupyter AI was criticized for being "unhelpful." This contrast in experiences suggests that not all AI tools are equally effective, and their integration into courses must be deliberate and well-supported.

2. **Learning Trade-Offs**:
   - Students acknowledged that while AI tools can make tasks easier and more efficient, they may inadvertently reduce opportunities for deeper learning. This dichotomy between efficiency and foundational understanding underscores the need for balanced integration.

#### **Recommendations Based on Analysis**
1. **Address Over-Reliance**:
   - Incorporate structured assignments that require students to solve problems without AI assistance to ensure they develop strong foundational skills.
   
2. **Leverage AI Strengths**:
   - Use AI tools strategically for tasks like debugging, error diagnosis, and project scaffolding, where they add clear value.

3. **Enhance AI Tool Integration**:
   - Address the technical issues with tools like Jupyter AI to ensure consistency and reliability across platforms.

4. **Balance Efficiency with Depth**:
   - Design assignments that combine AI-assisted tasks with independent problem-solving components to foster a balance between efficiency and conceptual learning.

#### **Summary**
The integration of AI coding assistance in this course was largely perceived as beneficial, particularly for problem-solving, debugging, and project planning. However, concerns about over-reliance, inconsistent tool performance, and gaps in foundational learning highlight the importance of deliberate and balanced implementation. Addressing these challenges will ensure that AI tools complement, rather than replace, critical thinking and independent problem-solving skills.
