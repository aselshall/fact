","-- / 1","","The least enjoyable aspect of the course was the first few lessons on python basics, which went quite slow and could have been studied more efficiently at home. ","-- / 1","","I feel that a lesson just on AI coding assistance is not entirely necessary, especially because much of the utility of having an integrated AI API key in the jupyter notebook can be replicate by simplying accessing ChatGPT, Copilot, or any other LLM online. Additionally, it may be worth reducing the lessons on Matplotlib and instead teaching it alongside other lessons.

The lessons for example can be modified such that we can do it on our own for homework, and class time would be reserved for advanced topics/case studies. This way, there is more reinforcement of knowledge and practice while saving time. ","-- / 1","","The instructors enthusiasm is very welcomed, and helps convey the importance of data science skills and programming.
